# Accurate Bucket Size Reporting

This update improves the accuracy of Backblaze B2 bucket size reporting by implementing more comprehensive methods to calculate storage usage.

## The Problem

The original implementation might report bucket sizes smaller than what Backblaze reports because:

1. It only sampled a limited number of files (up to 10,000)
2. It used estimation based on averages when buckets contained more files
3. It didn't fully account for all file versions or certain file types

## The Solution

This update provides more accurate bucket size reporting by:

1. Using a more comprehensive file listing approach that pages through all files
2. Properly handling file versions and hidden files 
3. Attempting to use direct bucket size information when available from the B2 API
4. Ensuring all file sizes are properly accounted for

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use the Improved Files Directly

1. Copy the improved files into your application:
   - `backblaze_api_improved.py` replaces `backblaze_api.py`
   - `app_improved.py` replaces `app.py`

2. Set the environment variable in your `.env` file:
   ```
   USE_ACCURATE_BUCKET_SIZE=True
   ```

### Option 2: Apply the Changes to Your Existing Files

If you prefer to modify your existing files, make these changes:

1. Add the `USE_ACCURATE_BUCKET_SIZE` setting to your `config.py`
2. Implement the `get_accurate_bucket_usage` method from `backblaze_api_improved.py`
3. Update the `get_bucket_usage` method to use the accurate method when enabled
4. Update any usage of the bucket size functions to respect the new setting

## Performance Considerations

The accurate bucket size calculation may:
- Make more API calls to Backblaze B2
- Take longer to process very large buckets
- Potentially increase your Backblaze transaction costs

If performance is critical, you can set `USE_ACCURATE_BUCKET_SIZE=False` to use the faster estimation method.

## API Call Limiting

The improved implementation includes safeguards to prevent excessive API calls:
- Maximum of 50 API calls per bucket size calculation
- Results are cached based on the `BUCKET_STATS_CACHE_HOURS` setting
- Large file traversal only happens when cache is expired

This provides a good balance between accuracy and API efficiency.
